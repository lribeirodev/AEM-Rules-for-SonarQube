<p>
    Resource Resolver has a life cycle which begins with the creation of the Resource Resolver using any of the factory
    methods and ends with calling the <code>close()</code> method. It is very important to call the <code>close()</code>
    method once the resource resolver is not used any more to ensure any system resources are properly clean up.

<h3>Noncompliant Code Example</h3>
<pre>
try {
    ResourceResolver resolver = resourceResolverFactory.getResourceResolver(authenticationInfoMap); // Noncompliant; resourceResolver should be closed in finally block
    // ...
} catch (Exception e) {
    // ...
}
</pre>
<br>
<pre>
try {
    ResourceResolver resolver = resourceResolverFactory.getResourceResolver(authenticationInfoMap); // Noncompliant; resourceResolver should be closed in finally block
    resolver.close();
} catch (Exception e) {
    // ...
}
</pre>
<h3>Compliant Solution</h3>
<pre>
ResourceResolver resolver = null;
try {
    resolver = resourceResolverFactory.getResourceResolver(authenticationInfoMap);
    // ...
} catch (LoginException e) {
    // ...
} finally {
    if (resolver != null) {
        resolver.close();
    }
}
</pre>
